<p>An unapologetic version 2.0, I am a second generation Indian programmer.I have learned from the use of Internet as a medium unlike the older programmers who relied on the books.It contains random musings about coding, best practices, philosophy, quizzes and yes like every other Indian I am passionate of discussion about Indian politics and other matters concerning India as well</p>
