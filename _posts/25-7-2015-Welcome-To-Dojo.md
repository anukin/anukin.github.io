Welcome to this humble endeavour.Since everything must begin with a plan, I have decided to outline what I will be doing with the blog.
1. Posts about culture, technology, programming etc
2. Since I belong to a country of _argumentative Indians_, there will be occasional posts about <i>Politics</i> and other stuff.
3. Occassionally there would be series inspired by books like *Pragmatic Programmer*

I have decided to go for a formatting that is similar to the [Codeless Code](http://thecodelesscode.com/).Since I believe we are all nothing but storytellers.Let us give this ancestral form of story telling a revival.

I think thats all I can go about it now.
